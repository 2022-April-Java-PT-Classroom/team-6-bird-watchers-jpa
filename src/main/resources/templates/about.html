          Hi! My name is Aisha (phonetic spelling: ay-zhuh).
          I am a junior full-stack software developer pursuing my passion in coding,
          reigniting the days of my youth where I'd make front-end websites of my
          favorite cartoon/video game characters in the early and late 2000s.

          I have a passion and a mind for efficiency in the flow of commodities across
          the nation, and now for the flow of information across the web: from the actual
          highways, to the information super-highway. An idyllic world is one where the
          customer experience is attractive and user-friendly, with the convenience of both
          mobile applications and the web. Technology should continue to be as accessible and
          forward-facing, as it is vital and integral to our daily lives.

          Born in Detroit, I moved to Columbus to attend graduate school at Ohio State. Although my focus was
          Cognitive/Experimental Psychology, I learned some coding in order to write programs for my experiments.
          After several years in logistics with Amazon, I decided to take up software development, continuing my
          education at WCCI. When I am not coding, I enjoy herping, which is similar to birdwatching, but with
          a focus on reptiles and amphibians.

          Im Victor, born in Cleveland, Ohio i always wanted to make the leap towards a tech career
          but i never had the opportunity to so in the meantime i decided to practice coding on my own
          and i always loved it. I did a few courses on udemy and learning through YouTube.
          At the Start of 2022 i figured It's now or never so i got referred by a friend who completed the WCCI bootcamp.
          So i decided to enroll to WCCI bootcamp, that has helped me learn in a fast pace environment and
          im very amazed at the structure of the program. After my certification i will be using it to transition
          into tech career and finally fulfilling my goal of pursuing a career in tech!

          I’m an experienced Human Resource professional currently working as an HR Partner for
          Amazon, with over 7 years of experience leading teams.
          This year, I’m fulfilling a personal goal by pivoting in my career to pursue a future in Tech. After
          learning Python and other languages on my own, I decided to enroll in an amazing bootcamp, WCCI, that
          has an accelerated approach to teaching and training future Software Engineers. Upon completion of my
          certification, I will be pursuing a position that will enhance my career. This position would challenge
          me to continue to learn, grow my knowledge and push me to construct and deliver software that will make
          a difference.
