                Hi! My name is Dhana P Acharya. I literally started from zero when first started coding in 2020.
                And, now I have more inclination to coding. My passion for coding has dismantled the world
                of obstacles that appeared on my way. All I do during my free time is coding or watching video

                Hi! My name is Aisha (phonetic spelling: ay-zhuh).
                I am a junior full-stack software developer pursuing my passion in coding,
                reigniting the days of my youth where I'd make front-end websites of my
                favorite cartoon/video game characters in the early and late 2000s.
                I am a highly focused problem solver with excellent research and troubleshooting skills,
                committed to breaking into the tech industry.

                I have a passion and a mind for efficiency in the flow of commodities across
                the nation, and now for the flow of information across the web: from the actual
                highways, to the information super-highway. An idyllic world is one where the
                customer experience is attractive and user-friendly, with the convenience of both
                mobile applications and the web. Technology should continue to be as accessible and
                forward-facing, as it is vital and integral to our daily lives.

                Born in Detroit, I moved to Columbus to attend graduate school at Ohio State. Although my focus was
                Cognitive/Experimental Psychology, I learned some coding in order to write programs for my experiments.
                After several years in logistics with Amazon, I decided to take up software development, continuing my
                education at WCCI. When I am not coding, I enjoy herping, which is similar to birdwatching, but with
                a focus on reptiles and amphibians.

                but I never had the opportunity to so in the meantime I decided to practice coding on my own
                and I always loved it. I did a few courses on udemy and learning through YouTube.
                At the Start of 2022 I figured It's now or never so i got referred by a friend who completed the WCCI
                bootcamp.
                So I decided to enroll to WCCI bootcamp, that has helped me learn in a fast pace environment and

                I’m an experienced Human Resource professional currently working as an HR Partner for
                Amazon, with over 7 years of experience leading teams.
                This year, I’m fulfilling a personal goal by pivoting in my career to pursue a future in Tech. After
                learning Python and other languages on my own, I decided to enroll in an amazing bootcamp, WCCI, that
                has an accelerated approach to teaching and training future Software Engineers. Upon completion of my
                certification, I will be pursuing a position that will enhance my career. This position would challenge
                me to continue to learn, grow my knowledge and push me to construct and deliver software that will make
                a difference.
